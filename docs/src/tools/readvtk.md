# Reading VTK files

The [ReadVTK.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/ReadVTK.jl) package, mainly written by [Michael Schlottke-Lakemper](https://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/NumSim/schlottke-lakemper) and the [Trixi authors](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/blob/main/AUTHORS.md), may be used to read VTK files.

Note that ReadVTK.jl is specifically meant for reading VTK XML files generated
by WriteVTK.jl, and may not be able to read VTK files coming from other
sources.

See the [ReadVTK.jl documentation](https://github.com/trixi-framework/ReadVTK.jl#what-works) for
details on what can and cannot be done with it.
